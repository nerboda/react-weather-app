Just a simple weather app built for self education purposes. It's built using react, redux, semantic ui and webpack.

## Roadmap

#### Styling and UI Improvements

* Load screen prior to app rendering
* City search:
  * Auto complete for city name/state
  * Validate city names/zips to prevent invalidate inputs
* Pop up confirmation window prior to deleting a location
* Add some space between current location segment and other locations

#### New Features

* Fetch state name too for new locations
  * Gonna have to make another third party API call
